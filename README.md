# Project-3-LangChain-Function-Tool-Calling-Calculator

This project builds a calculator using LangChain and the Google Gemini Flash model. It allows users to perform mathematical calculations through **natural language queries**. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, as well as more advanced functions like logarithms, trigonometry, and square roots. It leverages LangChain's **tool-calling ** capabilities to execute calculations and maintains conversation history for context. 

The project demonstrates how to **integrate a language model with external tools **to create a more interactive and functional application.
